# Links – Golf Taste Tracker (Figma Make Export)

This repo contains the exported codebase from **Figma Make** for the project **Links** — a social golf scorecard app where users log rounds, rank courses, and build a personal taste profile.

This repo will serve as the base for:
- Debugging layout issues from Figma Make output
- Refactoring components for clean HTML/CSS/JS
- Potentially porting key layouts into SwiftUI or React Native

---

## 🧠 About the Product

**Links** lets golfers:
- Log rounds and tag courses (Public, Private, Muni, $$, etc.)
- Compare two courses head-to-head
- Build a personal “Top 5”
- See where friends have played and what they liked

---

## 🔧 Project Setup

This repo was initialized with raw code from Figma Make. It may include:
- Unused classes or components
- Redundant styles or layout bugs
- HTML with placeholder text or inconsistent structure

You’ll use this as a foundation to:
- Debug UI issues
- Simplify structure
- Migrate to real mobile code if needed

---

## 🧰 Next Steps

1. Clone the repo locally
2. Use Codex / Cursor / GPT-4 to:
   - Debug layout screen-by-screen
   - Optimize structure
   - Clean unused code
3. Optionally convert into SwiftUI or React Native screen-by-screen
