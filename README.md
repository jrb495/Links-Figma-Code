## ðŸ§  About the Product

**Links** lets golfers:
- Log rounds and tag courses (Public, Private, Muni, $$, etc.)
- Compare two courses head-to-head
- Build a personal "Top 5"
- See where friends have played and what they liked

## ðŸ”§ Project Setup

This repo was initialized with raw code from Figma Make. It may include:
- Unused classes or components
- Redundant styles or layout bugs
- HTML with placeholder text or inconsistent structure

You'll use this as a foundation to:
- Debug UI issues
- Simplify structure
- Migrate to real mobile code if needed

## ðŸ§° Next Steps

1. Clone the repo locally
2. Use Codex / Cursor / GPT-4 to:
   - Debug layout screen-by-screen
   - Optimize structure
   - Clean unused code
3. Optionally convert into SwiftUI or React Native screen-by-screen
